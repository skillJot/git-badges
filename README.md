## Crafting Badges for Existing Skills or Achievements

Should you wish to create a badge for an existing skill or achievement, we'll create a dedicated directory awaiting your contributions.

## Badge Naming Guidelines

- To ensure uniformity, kindly adhere to this naming convention: `<skill/achievement>-<optional: brand>-YYYYMMDD.<extension>`.
- Be respectful.

Stay tuned for forthcoming, comprehensive guidelines as we embark on this exciting journey of badge design transformation! Join us today.

## Brand Name Usage
